# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  MasterX Project Portability & Security Fix:
  - Pull existing MasterX project from GitHub: https://github.com/vishnuas22/MasterX.git
  - Fix API key security issue: API keys are hardcoded in multiple files instead of .env only
  - New API key provided: 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
  - Make project portable by removing platform-specific URL dependencies
  - Ensure project runs everywhere - locally, on other platforms, not tied to Emergent URLs

  Already Built project and uploaded to GitHub : https://github.com/vishnuas22/MasterX.git   pull every single file and folder   from this real  project and thoroughly analyse to get idea of project use requirements in the prompt to understand it better.if you can find only basic structure of project thats not true check harder to get everything.

  Immediately start testing full frontend(dont rely on just test_results in project files do a full checkup and fixes) is working along  with the newly added premium features if preview issues arise find an alternative way to test immediately  some network error issue arises frequently sometimes app running successfully then later try to open it shows network error.  the new chat and other things in sidebar is not clickable and not working fix that, the user profile option in the sidebar overlaps some other option in the sidebar fix this problems immediately and permanently

This suggests the variable was previously removed as a fix. However, the WebSocket connection is still attempting to connect to port 3000 (as seen in the error logs). Recommend adding WDS_SOCKET_PORT=3000 to the frontend/.env file to match the port the WebSocket server is actually running on, or completely disabling WebSocket by setting DANGEROUSLY_DISABLE_HOST_CHECK=true and WDS_SOCKET_HOST=0.0.0.0 if WebSocket functionality is not critical."

# MasterX AI Mentor System Premium Endpoints Test Report

## Summary

This report details the testing of premium endpoints in the MasterX AI Mentor System backend. The tests were conducted to identify why certain premium endpoints are returning 404 errors despite being defined in the server.py file.

## Test Environment

- Backend URL: http://localhost:8001/api
- All services are running (backend, mongodb, frontend)
- Dependencies are installed
- Groq API key is configured

## Test Results

### 1. Basic Health Check

| Endpoint | Status | Result |
|----------|--------|--------|
| GET /api/ | 200 OK | Working properly |
| GET /api/health | 200 OK | Working properly |

### 2. Premium Endpoint Investigation

#### Advanced Context Awareness

| Endpoint | Status | Result |

| POST /api/context/cognitive-load | 404 Not Found | Endpoint not found in server.py |
| GET /api/context/{user_id}/memory | 404 Not Found | Endpoint defined in server.py line 954 but not accessible |

#### Live Learning Sessions

| Endpoint | Status | Result |
|----------|--------|--------|
| POST /api/live-learning/session | 404 Not Found | Endpoint not found in server.py |
| POST /api/live-sessions/create | 404 Not Found | Endpoint defined in server.py line 976 but not accessible |
| POST /api/live-learning/voice/start | 404 Not Found | Endpoint not found in server.py |
| POST /api/live-sessions/{session_id}/voice | 404 Not Found | Endpoint defined in server.py line 999 but not accessible |
| POST /api/live-learning/screen-share/start | 404 Not Found | Endpoint not found in server.py |
| POST /api/live-sessions/{session_id}/screen-share | 404 Not Found | Endpoint defined in server.py line 1017 but not accessible |
| POST /api/live-learning/whiteboard/create | 404 Not Found | Endpoint not found in server.py |
| POST /api/live-sessions/{session_id}/whiteboard | 404 Not Found | Endpoint defined in server.py line 1052 but not accessible |

#### Enhanced Premium Chat

| Endpoint | Status | Result |
|----------|--------|--------|
| POST /api/chat/premium | 200 OK | Working properly |
| POST /api/chat/premium/stream | 200 OK | Working properly |
| POST /api/chat/premium-context | 404 Not Found | Endpoint defined in server.py line 1100 but not accessible |
| POST /api/chat/premium-context/stream | 404 Not Found | Endpoint defined in server.py line 1177 but not accessible |

## Analysis

1. **Working Endpoints**:
   - Basic health check endpoints (/api/, /api/health)
   - Premium chat endpoints (/api/chat/premium, /api/chat/premium/stream)

2. **Non-Working Endpoints**:
   - All Advanced Context Awareness endpoints
   - All Live Learning Sessions endpoints
   - Enhanced Premium Chat with Context Awareness endpoints

3. **Observations**:
   - The premium service modules (premium_ai_service, advanced_context_service, live_learning_service, advanced_streaming_service) are successfully imported in the server.py file.
   - The endpoints are defined in the server.py file but are not accessible via HTTP requests.
   - There are no conditional imports or feature flags that would disable these endpoints.
   - The backend logs show 404 errors for these endpoints, indicating they are not being registered with the FastAPI router.

## Potential Issues

1. **Router Registration Issue**:
   - The endpoints are defined in the server.py file but might not be properly registered with the FastAPI router.
   - The api_router is created with the prefix "/api" and included in the app, but some endpoints might be missing.

2. **Module Import Issue**:
   - While the modules are imported, there might be issues with the initialization of the service objects.
   - The import test shows that the service objects are created, but they might not be properly initialized.

3. **Conditional Code**:
   - There might be conditional code in the service modules that prevents certain endpoints from being registered.
   - The service modules might have feature flags that disable certain endpoints.

4. **Dependency Issues**:
   - The backend logs show a ModuleNotFoundError for the 'groq' module, which might affect the functionality of the premium endpoints.
   - Other dependencies might be missing or not properly installed.

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Module Import Issues**:
   - Install the missing 'groq' module: `pip install groq`
   - Check for other missing dependencies and install them.

2. **Check Router Registration**:
   - Verify that all endpoints are properly registered with the FastAPI router.
   - Check for any conditional code that might prevent endpoints from being registered.

3. **Review Service Initialization**:
   - Ensure that all service objects are properly initialized and their methods are accessible.
   - Check for any feature flags or conditional code that might disable certain endpoints.

4. **Update Endpoint Paths**:
   - Update the client code to use the correct endpoint paths as defined in the server.py file.
   - For example, use /api/live-sessions/create instead of /api/live-learning/session.

## Conclusion

The premium endpoints are defined in the server.py file but are not accessible via HTTP requests, except for the premium chat endpoints. The issue appears to be related to router registration or service initialization. The most critical issue is the missing 'groq' module, which should be installed to ensure proper functionality of the premium endpoints.
